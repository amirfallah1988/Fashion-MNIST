# Fashion-MNIST

In this repository I have considered the classification problem of popular fashion-mnist dataset. The problem is classical classification problem with 10 classes. You can find 3 deep learning approaches that I used to solve this problem. Each approach was made based on the result of the previous approach and by seeing the problems in previous approach.<br>
you can find each approach with its full expalanation in notebooks with relatd names. But before review them there are some points that necessary to mention: <br>
**_ All the codes are in python. I have used tensorflow and keras as tools to construct my networks.** <br>
**_ To better understand my mind journey, please read the approaches in correct order (from first to third).** <br>
**_ In designing the models, I payed attention to two important aspects:** <br>
_A) Accuracy of model_ <br>
_B) Complexity of model_ <br>
so I tried to design simple models. Besides, unfortunately my laptop configuration is too weak (core i.5 and 6 GB ram, without GPU!), so I was compelled to choose simple model, which can be trained on CPU.<br>
**_ Many of parameters can be check for improvement in model performance, So the research can be continued on these approaches.**
